          Rx: Curing Your Asynchronous 
                                    Programming Blues
        </h1>
        <h2>Erik Meijer</h2>
        <p>
        Asynchronous, event-driven &quot;reactive&quot; programming is way too hard in 
        today's world of development tools and frameworks. The huge amount of 
        manual and error-prone plumbing leads to incomprehensible and hard to 
        maintain code. As we reach out to services in the cloud, the desire for 
        asynchronous computation is ever increasing, requiring a fresh look on 
        the problems imposed by reactive programming. Centered around the 
        concept of observable data sources, Rx provides a framework that takes 
        care of the hard parts of reactive programming. Instead of focusing on 
        the hard parts, you now can start dreaming about the endless 
        possibilities of composing queries over asynchronous data sources, 
        piggybacking on convenient LINQ syntax. In this session, we'll cover the
        design philosophy of Rx, rooted on the deep duality between the 
        interactive IEnumerable interface and the new reactive IObservable 
        interface in .NET 4. From this core understanding, we'll start looking 
        at various combinators and operators defined over observable 
        collections, as provided by Rx, driving concepts home by a bunch of 
        samples. Finally, if time permits, we'll look at the Reactive Extensions
        for JavaScript which allows us to take the concepts we already know 
        from Rx and apply them to JavaScript and have deep integration with 
        libraries such as jQuery.&nbsp; Democratizing asynchronous programming starts
        today. Don't miss out on it!

        Calling everything a service

        services and no clue when to use which one. Is a single operation a 
        service? Is a single endpoint a service? What about cross cutting 
        functions like authorization and data access? If you've been wondering 
        about these sorts of questions, then this talk is for you. If you've

          Fully Modular, Statically Typed, 
                                    Symmetric Multimethod Dispatch
        </h1>
        <h2>Guy L. Steele, Jr.</h2>
        <p>
        The Fortress programming language integrates traditional mathematical
        notation into an object-oriented framework based on traits with
        multiple inheritance, overloading (of both methods and functions)
        resolved by symmetric dynamic dispatch, static types, and separately
        compiled modules.  A component/API system governs visibility of traits,
        objects, and functions, but it is desirable to regard overloadings that
        are visible to the callee as part of its implementation, even though
        they may not be visible to the caller.  This complicates the rules for dispatch.
        Simply put, the same method name may refer to different methods
        in different compilation units, depending on the import and export declarations,
        and the implementation has to make it all work.
        </p>
        <p>
        Moreover, a longstanding problem with multiple inheritance is what to do when
        methods inherited from several parents conflict.  Many approaches have
        been explored in the literature; some unfortunately violate the
        intuitively desirable requirement that the function or method invoked
        be the uniquely most specific one that is both accessible and
        applicable.  Fortress detects potential overloading ambiguity at compile time
        and issues error messages explaining to the programmer what additional
        overloadings are needed to resolve the problem; therefore it is impossible for any
        function or method call to be ambiguous.  This idea goes back nearly
        two decades, but Fortress appears to be the first programming language
        to adopt the idea and enforce it statically, even in the face of separate compilation.
        It enables a distributed implementation of dispatching that is easy to explain
        and allows selective export and selective optimization.  In this way a single
        strategy meets the requirements of both the multimethod dispatch and the
        component visibility rules.

        <h2>Pamela Fox</h2>
        <p>
        Google App Engine is a framework that lets you build web apps on top of Google's scalable hosting and data storage infrastructure. When you start building an app on App Engine, you soon realize that you do things differently from the way you made apps for more &quot;traditional&quot; hosting setups, because of our scalability-oriented design. In this talk, we'll give an overview of App Engine, and then look at how you would handle things like offline processing, geographic queries, or storing files, and how you would design real world apps like a microblogging service or social network site.

        <h1>Testing Your Javascript</h1>
        <h2>Corey Haines</h2>
        <p>
        With the advent of new, fast virtual machines and frameworks for both in- and out-of-browser usage, Javascript has stepped into its rightful place as a productive, object-oriented language. More and more, we see full-featured applications being built entirely in this great language. Unfortunately, a lot of the coding habits remain from its humble origin as 'just an html scripting language.' Automated testing is accepted as standard in most other languages, why not in Javascript? 
        </p>
        <p>
        In this talk, we'll look at techniques and tools for testing your Javascript effectively. Just getting the tools set up can be daunting, so we'll spend some time looking at setup. Testing interactions with your HTML can be tricky, so we'll cover tips for effectively interacting with your web pages in your tests.

          Strategic Design: Avoiding 
                                    Responsibility Traps
        </h1>
        <h2>Eric Evans</h2>
        <p>
        As software development leaders, we need to think more strategically. Some design decisions affect the trajectory of the whole project or even the organization. These decisions arise in early chartering and throughout development, and they are about much more than architecture. This talk will examine these issues through the lens of the Strategic Design principles of domain-driven design (DDD), which systematize a few critical practices some successful teams do intuitively. <br />
        <br />
        It is common for skilled teams to deliver software they are not proud of, due to compromises with legacy designs. Others toil for years, producing a platform that is never used to good advantage. These are strategic failures. On the other hand, there are projects with a direct explanation of how the software contributes to business goals. There are projects where designers work with a realistic view of the context of their development within the larger system, allowing them to maintain design clarity and integrity. These are strategic successes. Winning strategy starts with the domain. <br />
        <br />
        Two DDD principles, &quot;Context Mapping&quot; and &quot;Distilling the Core Domain&quot;, help you see your strategic situation more clearly and approach strategic design decisions more systematically. These techniques require extensive interaction with domain experts as well as the leaders of the organization, in discussions broader than functional requirements. They sometimes lead to priorities quite different from our most comfortable notions. <br />

        <p>
        People have been talking about &quot;scaling&quot; and &quot;distributed systems&quot; a 
        great deal lately.  We need to clarify the meaning of these terms in 
        order to have a worthwhile conversation about them.  We will do so by 
        discussing the details of how to actually produce practical, scalable, 
        distributed systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        That discussion will focus on methods for designing and building 
        robust fundamentally-concurrent distributed systems.  These approaches 
        have been learned through building user-facing web applications, data 
        storage and processing systems, and server management tools.  We will 
        look at practices that are &quot;common knowledge&quot; but too often forgotten, 
        at lessons that the software industry at large has somehow missed, and 
        at general &quot;good practices&quot; and rules that must be thrown away when 
        moving into a distributed and concurrent world.

        <p>
        Google is known to operate one of the largest civilian computing infrastructures. These hardware resources are managed by a vast collection of software frameworks and tools, which form the basis for highly parallelized, reliable, low-latency, high-throughput applications. They also provide useful programming abstractions that speed up development and debugging. Some parts of this infrastructure, such as MapReduce, GFS, Sawzall, Chubby, Protocol Buffers, are available as open source projects or published in academic papers, while others are proprietary. Rather than dive into the dark corners of each of these tools, this talk tries to distill key design themes 
        and patterns, which enable these unique capabilities, and can be re-used in other contexts.

                                    in Erlang land
        </h1>
        <h2>Kresten Krab Thorup</h2>
        <p>
        Erlang is a programming language which has been picking up steam the last few years, in particular in domains that require a lot of coordination in the application logic.  The language supports a simple and consistent set of features for writing concurrent distributed systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        Over the last few years, I have been meeting &quot;Erlang people&quot; more and more often, and I have been getting the impression that they have a magical ability to reason intuitively about concurrent systems in a way that I have not. It corresponds somewhat to the way we &quot;object heads&quot; think intuitively about classes and objects - just in terms of processes. That bothered me, so I wanted to learn Erlang.
        </p>
        <p>
        Being a language implementor, the most obvious way to do that is to just go ahead and implement an Erlang VM, right?  The result of this &quot;little exercise&quot; is Erjang, an open-source JVM-based Erlang VM. It has turned into a non-trivial project, Erjang is now +50k lines of Java code, and it runs substantial erlang programs.
        </p>
        <p>
        This adventure to Erlang-land have taught me many things about how &quot;Erlang people&quot; think.  I am beginning to understand how they think in processes/actors, how they model things and how they handle the complexity that arises in concurrent systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the first part of my talk, I'll go through some of these lessons, some of the aha!'s and the insights into Erlang's secret sauce, and present some of the patterns Erlang'ers use to describe and model systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        Secondly, I'll take you through some of the highlights of the Erjang VM; which is just another angle at describing how Erlang and Java differs.

        Languages - what's to learn from them? Relics of the past; we know how to design them / to use them. Types / messages / invocation / loops / numbers / methods / big ol' libraries / lots of = signs. Heh, but what is programming, and what role do programming languages play in that process? We have learned a lot over the last five decades: organizing principles, established conventions, theory, fashions, and fads. &quot;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&quot; In this talk we survey what we think are the most important lessons of the past that future programmers, and future programming language designers, ought not forget. We illustrate each lesson by discussing specific programming languages of the past, and endeavor to shine what light we can on the future.

        <h1>Monster Builds (and how to tame them)</h1>
        <h2>Chris Mountford</h2>
        <p>
        Continuous Integration is great but what happens when your builds get out of control? What happens when you have too many build plans, that
        take way too long to execute? How do you keep a handle on growing complexity and how do you measure and control build reliability? How
        do you stop builds growing into a rampaging monster and running amok destroying the city with its death rays and bullet-proof teeth?
        </p>
        <p>
        As the number of features, tests, supported platforms and the number of developers and customers grows, there comes a time when you need
        serious engineering in your build if you want any hope of staying Agile.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this presenation you will learn how to tame the monsters hiding in your builds, hopefully before they get out of control.

        <h1>Emergent Design</h1>
        <h2>Neal Ford</h2>
        <p>
        This session describes the current thinking about <i>emergent</i> design, discovering design in code. The hazard of Big Design Up Front in software is that you don't yet know what you don't know, and design decisions made too early are just speculations without facts. Emergent design techniques allow you to wait until the last responsible moment to make design decisions. This talk covers four areas: emergent design enablers, battling things that make emergent design hard, finding 
        idiomatic patterns, and how to leverage the patterns you find. It includes both proactive (test-driven development) and reactive (refactoring, metrics, visualizations, tests) approaches to discovering design, and discusses the use of custom attributes, DSLs, and other techniques for utilizing them. The goal of this talk is to provide nomenclature, strategies, and techniques for allowing <i>design</i> to emerge from projects as they proceed, keeping your code in sync with the problem domain.

        The Web has never been more open to everyone. Open Data services exist in almost every web application: from social networking apps to governmental pages and the news, all this data can be instantly accessed by exposed APIs. However, although most of this data is offered in a simple interchange format, its structures are quite complex, ranging from complex networks to time-based information, hierarchical data or heavy graphs. Displaying this data in a manner that enables the viewer to gain some insight can be challenging, especially if we aim at providing some interaction and doing it in a cross-browser/cross-device manner. The JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit creates interactive data visualizations for the Web. It's based solely on Web Standards, leveraging the power of native browser technologies to provide insights on complex data. In this talk you will learn about the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit and how it can help you create advanced data visualizations for the Web.

        Henry Ford changed the world through the manufacturing machinery he created over 100 years ago. Separating 'thinking' from 'doing', Mr Ford defined a management archetype for large western organisations that still persists over a century later. But as we move to an information age at break-neck speed, does command &amp; control management still look as compelling?<br />
        <br />
        In this presentation, Richard will discuss the history of management science and how management techniques affect the performance of technology teams and IT divisions.&nbsp;He&nbsp;will demonstrate the fundamental differences between today's two prevalent management theories: Scientific Management Theory and Systems Management Theory. He will explore the&nbsp;foundations of management theory in philosophical thought, the development of management models through political and military leadership, and ultimately the application of management concepts in today's information age. Richard will investigate a number of case studies from IT and beyond, presenting empirical evidence that demonstrates a change in management philosophy can directly affect business results. This presentation is a must for anyone interested in or involved in enterprise level Agile adoption or simply with an interest in hearing more on 'Lean &amp; Systems Thinking' from an experienced practitioner.

        Conventional wisdom says that memory is fast, disk is slow, networks are slower and that fast systems must be highly concurrent to achieve maximum performance. Much of this is outdated and some of it is now wrong. Modern hardware is phenomenally fast, but we have become complacent and use it in extremely inefficient and inappropriate ways. 
        </p>
        <p>
        For world class performance on commodity hardware you need to take a holistic approach to software design. The good news is that all the stuff we learned in computer science 101 is what really matters, choose your data structures carefully, model your domain, understand your platform, work hard to have a clear separation of concerns, but as well as all of that, run your business logic on a single thread!?

        The ability to collect and store data continues to increase, but our ability to understand it remains unchanged. Data visualization makes use of our evolutionary proclivity for decoding visual images and employs this ability as a high-bandwidth means of getting data into our heads. In this talk, I'll present work I've developed ranging from illustrations of data for magazines and journals to software tools used by geneticists to interactive applications for Fortune 10 companies.

        We are building the same types of systems as we built yesterday,
        the demands placed on our systems becomes more and more demanding. We
        need to handle more users, offer more intelligent behavior, provide
        different behavior for differenet clients, parallelize both development
        and deployment, handle partial failures in our applications, offer the
        operations team rich insight into our systems and the ability to tweak
        them at runtime and so much more.
        </p>
        <p>
        Trying to build such application using the standard
        N-tiered architecture has proven to be hard, challenging and complex.
        In this session, you will learn how changing some of the underlying
        architectural concepts in how we build applications can lead to simpler
        solutions that scale extremely well. Those concepts include divide and
        conquer, background evaluation, one way messaging and ruthless
        application of the single responsibility principle. We will cover the

        <h1>What is This   Thing Called "Pull"?</h1>
        <h2>Mary Poppendieck</h2>
        <p>
        Pull means a lot of things to a lot of people: 
        </p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Pull = Pursuing Passion </li>
        	<li>Pull = Putting Customers First </li>
        	<li>Pull = Producing Based on Demand </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        These definitions of pull have something in common; they all contain a strong element of observation, orientation, decision, and action &ndash; the OODA loop. As the pace of business increases and unexpected events become common, pull becomes like an increasingly attractive alternative to push. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The problem is, pull doesn't work without preparation. Pull requires an environment that sends the correct signals, methods to rapidly detect the right patterns, and people who have the skills and training to make the right decisions. So the real challenge of pull is creating the environment, devising the patterns, and developing the people that ensure the right decisions are made and rapidly carried out, no matter what situation presents itself.

        </h1>
        <h2>Brian Oliver</h2>
        <p>
        Building scalable, highly-available applications that perform well is not an easy task. These features cannot be simply &ldquo;bolted&rdquo; onto an existing application &ndash; they have to be 
        architected into it. Unfortunately, the things we need to do to achieve them are often in conflict with each other, and finding the right balance is crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this session we will discuss why scaling web applications is difficult and will look at some of solutions we have come up with in the past to deal with the issues involved. We will then look 
        at how in-memory data grids can make our jobs easier by providing a solid architectural foundation to build our applications on top of.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you are new to in-memory data grids, you are guaranteed to leave the presentation eager to learn more. However, even if you are already using one you will likely walk out with a few ideas on 
        how to improve performance and scalability of your applications.
